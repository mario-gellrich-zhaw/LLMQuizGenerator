Create [qTopics] 'multiple choice single answer' questions for each topic listed below.
In total there must be [qTotal] questions. 
This limit should be enforced. If there are not enough topics to get to the total, 
create more questions, chosing topics from the list at random. If there are too many topics, also choose at random.
If you have to create less or more questions per topic to get to that limit, do that.
In any case, the total questions should be enforced, this is the most important part!!!
Also keep in mind, the response must be a valid JSON format, so make sure to escape anything that needs it!
Use the following structure: question, code, options, answer, and topic. 
Create [qOptions] options for each question. 
The difficulty must be at an [qDiffFrom] to [qDiffTo] level. 
It should take about one minute to answer the question. 
Then Display questions as list of dictionaries in questions = [].
Also generate a generic title for the quiz.
Do not stop until the total amount of questions has been reached.

Here is the structure for the response. This structure is crucial and should not be changed and should always look like this and be a valid json!
{
"title" = "",

"questions" = [
    {
        "question": "",
        "code": "",
        "options": ["", "", "", "", ""],
        "answer": "",
        "topic": ""
    }
]
}
